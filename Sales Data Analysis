Scenario:
You're working for a company that sells motorcycle parts, and they've asked for some help in analyzing their sales data!
They operate three warehouses in the area, selling both retail and wholesale. They offer a variety of parts and accept credit cards, cash, and bank transfer as payment methods. However, each payment type incurs a different fee.
The board of directors wants to gain a better understanding of wholesale revenue by product line, and how this varies month-to-month and across warehouses. You have been tasked with calculating net revenue for each product line and grouping results by month and warehouse. The results should be filtered so that only "Wholesale" orders are included.
They have provided you with access to their database, which contains the following table called sales:

Sales Table:
 


Problem:
Find out how much Wholesale net revenue each product_line generated per month per warehouse in the dataset.
•	The query should be saved as revenue_by_product_line using the SQL cell provided, and contain the following:
o	product_line,
o	month: displayed as 'June', 'July', and 'August',
o	warehouse, and
o	net_revenue: the sum of total minus the sum of payment_fee.
•	The results should be sorted by product_line and month, followed by net_revenue in descending order.

SQL code (PostGreSQL)
WITH revenue_by_product_line AS
	(SELECT
		product_line,
		TO_CHAR(DATE_TRUNC('month', date), 'Month') AS month,
		warehouse,
		SUM(total) - SUM(payment_fee) AS net_revenue
	FROM sales
	 WHERE DATE_PART('month', date) IN (6, 7, 8)
	 AND client_type = 'Wholesale'
	 GROUP BY product_line, month, warehouse)
SELECT 
	product_line,
	month,
	warehouse,
	net_revenue
FROM revenue_by_product_line
	 ORDER BY product_line, month, warehouse, net_revenue DESC;


Result:
